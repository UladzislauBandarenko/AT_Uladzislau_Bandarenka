Task Description
Tests for Web UI Automation were implemented using NUnit and xUnit. The following features were implemented:

Parallel test execution.
Setup/TearDown.
Data Provider.
Test Categories.

Framework	Passed	Failed	Skipped	Total	Duration
NUnit	3	0	0	3	10.2 seconds
xUnit	3	0	0	3	9.9 seconds
Conclusions

Overall Test Execution:
Both frameworks (NUnit and xUnit) executed all 3 tests successfully with no failures or skipped tests. The tests were reliable and stable in both environments.

Execution Time:
xUnit completed the tests slightly faster, with a total duration of 9.9 seconds. NUnit took 10.2 seconds, which is a 0.3-second difference. The time difference is minimal but still indicates a slight performance advantage for xUnit.

Parallel Execution:
Both frameworks support parallel test execution, and both performed well in this aspect. However, NUnit provides more out-of-the-box features for parallel test execution, making it easier to configure in some cases.

Ease of Use:
I found that NUnit was easier to work with for configuring parallelism, Setup/TearDown methods, and data provider functionality. While xUnit is also user-friendly, NUnit gave me a bit more flexibility and simplicity when setting up these features.

Final Thoughts:
Both frameworks performed well with minimal differences in execution time. xUnit was slightly faster, and I found it to be more convenient for my specific needs, especially when working with simpler test setups.
